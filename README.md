Student Project Numerical Analysis 1
====================================

This task deals with simplified 1D traffic flow modeled by the non-linear Burgers' equation. It is designed for a 1-month project work for students of Numerical Analysis 1 at TU Delft. The course is based on this [text book].

Note that two different versions of the task have been designed. If you are an instructor interested in a solution sheet (and Matlab codes), please write to [me].
